 Malware Analysis Scoring System

We developed a scoring system to assess the security of a computer system and detect potential malware. We began by identifying key features that could be impacted by malware, such as the OS version, antivirus software, number of LNK files, and TCP connections. We then refined this preliminary list into a final set of important features that would form the basis of our scoring methodology. 

A higher score indicated a more secure system with less likelihood of malware infection, while a lower score suggested potential issues that could be addressed to enhance security. This provided a standardized way to assess security across different systems.

Operating the Application
The user sees the welcome screen first. When the user clicks on “Start Now”, they will be directed to the login screen. If they are a new user, they can sign up and then log in again. After this, the user will be directed to the homepage. There is a menu bar on the left side where the user can gain information about the application and other existing solutions. On the right side, the user can click on “Scan” to start scanning the system. After the scan is completed, the user will automatically be directed to the next page where they can see their total protection score and protection scores based on individual features.
